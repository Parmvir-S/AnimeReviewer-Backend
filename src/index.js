/*
The code is using the require function to import an app module and then 
calling the listen function of the app object. The listen function starts 
the server and makes it listen for incoming requests on a specified port.

Therefore, this code assumes that the app module contains a properly configured 
Express application. If the app module is implemented correctly, then calling app.listen() 
will start the server and make it available to handle incoming requests. This code will run 
everything that is defined in the app module.
